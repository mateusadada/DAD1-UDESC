## 🚀 Starting

Explain what's VPL.

This repository contains all the solved exercises from Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming course of second semester. The exercises have more complex and challenging concepts, as well as the use of classes. It was fundamental to improve my knowledge in this language and it also helped with my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at [UDESC](https://www.udesc.br/).

## 📚 Features

Used during the evolution of exercises:

- Natural structures

- Chained lists

- Chained queues

- Chained stacks

- Balanced trees

- Algorithms for manipulating structures
